"""
Scaling-law derivation: given parameter/FLOPs counts for a model (and its d12 muP reference),
derive the training horizon (iterations/tokens), batch size, and the learning-rate/weight-decay
corrections that follow from it.

Pulled out of scripts/base_train.py's module body -- which has no main() and starts a real
training run on import -- so scripts/model_info.py can report the exact same numbers without
training anything. base_train.py still owns every print statement itself (some are grepped
verbatim by runs/scaling_laws.sh and runs/miniseries.sh -- see AGENTS.md); this module is pure
math with no I/O, architecture-agnostic (it only needs scalar counts, not a model).
