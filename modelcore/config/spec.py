"""
The materialized-tree config every modelcore.Model is built from -- the ONE format core
understands. See docs/architecture.md's "Composed architectures" section for the design this
continues (Stage 6 called it ComposedConfig; Stage 7 makes it the only format, so it drops the
qualifier).

Every component (embedding, block, unembedding, composer, shared component like RoPE) is one
ComponentSpec: its type under a "#type" key, its already-concrete constructor kwargs as siblings.
The "#" sigil can't collide with a parameter name (no Python identifier contains it), so no
namespacing wrapper is needed. A composer is a component like any other -- config.body's own
"#type" names the composer, and its per-layer block list is just one of its params (conventionally
named "blocks") -- so nothing in this schema privileges "a stack of blocks": a composer with
several block lists, or one nesting another composer, is expressible without a schema change.
