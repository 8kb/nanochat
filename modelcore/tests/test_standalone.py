"""
Mechanical guard for modelcore's standalone-ness: AST-scans every .py file under modelcore/
(package and its own tests) and asserts none of them import anything from the host application
(nanochat, scripts, tasks) or its dev/ tooling. This is what makes `cp -r modelcore /somewhere/else`
a real, testable claim rather than an aspiration -- see docs/roadmap.md's Stage 8.

A docstring or comment mentioning "nanochat" is fine (and common -- see e.g. modelcore/store.py's
own module docstring); only actual import statements are checked.
