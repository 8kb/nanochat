"""
The three module contracts every modelcore component obeys: token ids in, residual-stream
activations out (BaseEmbedding); one residual-stream transform step (BaseBlock); residual-stream
activations out, logits or loss (BaseUnembedding). Internal to modelcore -- a component knows it
must implement these, but nothing about how or by whom it's assembled into a model (that's
modelcore.model.Model, driven by a config tree).
